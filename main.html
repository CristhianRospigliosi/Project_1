        <div id="history">
          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <p>The history of the Japanese language is marked by its origins in the Ryukyuan family, likely brought to Japan from the Korean peninsula around the 4th century BC, and its subsequent evolution through periods like Old, Early Middle, and Late Middle Japanese, with influences from Chinese and later, European languages. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="first-step">
          <h2>FIRST STEP</h2>
          <p>The Japanese writing system combines Chinese characters, known as kanji, with two unique syllabaries derived by the Japanese from the more complex Chinese characters: hiragana and katakana. Latin script is also used in a limited fashion in Japanese writing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 id="kanji">KANJI</h2>
          <p>Kanji are logographic Chinese characters, adapted from Chinese script, used in the writing of Japanese. They were made a major part of the Japanese writing system during the time of Old Japanese and are still used, along with the subsequently-derived syllabic scripts of hiragana and katakana. The characters have Japanese pronunciations, most have two. There are nearly 3,000 kanji used in Japanese names and in common communication.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hiragana">
          <h2>HIRAGANA</h2>
          <p>Hiragana are used for words without kanji representation, for words no longer written in kanji, for replacement of rare kanji that may be unfamiliar to intended readers, and also following kanji to show conjugational endings. Because of the way verbs in Japanese are conjugated, kanji alone cannot fully convey Japanese tense and mood, as kanji cannot be subject to variation when written without losing their meaning. For this reason, hiragana are appended to kanji to show verb and adjective conjugations</p>
          </div>
        <div id="katakana">
          <h2>KATAKANA</h2>
          <p>Katakana, like hiragana, constitute a syllabary; katakana are primarily used to write foreign words, plant and animal names, and for emphasis. For example, "Australia" has been adapted as Ōsutoraria (オーストラリア), and "supermarket" has been adapted and shortened into sūpā (スーパー).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="learning">
          <h2>LEARNING</h2>
          <p class="list">To learn Japanese effectively, start by mastering the Hiragana and Katakana alphabets, then gradually build your vocabulary and grammar knowledge through a combination of online resources, textbooks, apps, and practice with native speakers.
          </p>
          <p class="list">
            Learn Hiragana and Katakana: These are the two phonetic alphabets used in Japanese, essential for reading and writing. 
          </p>
          <p class="list"> 
  Basic Grammar: Start with fundamental grammar concepts like particles, verb conjugations, and sentence structure. 
          </p>
          <p class="list">
  Vocabulary: Begin with common words and phrases, gradually expanding your vocabulary as you learn.    </p>
